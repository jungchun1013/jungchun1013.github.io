								<!-- <p>My research focuses on the integration of human cognition and perception across various domains to address real-world comprehensive problems. Specifically, I investigate the decomposition of cognitive modules and their interactive dynamics.</p>

								<p>During my undergraduate studies, I conducted a psychological research project exploring the disparities in eye movements on cognitive and perceptual workload. The result shows opposite effects of the two types of mental workload on fixation-related parameters. This study revealed insights into the potential separation of cognitive and perceptual processes, evident in behavioral patterns.</p>
									
								<p>For my master's research, I developed a framework that automatically induces subtasks and constructs task structures to tackle hierarchical and compositional decision-making problems. The framework decompose high-level abstractions and low-level execution for classical planning and deep reinforcement learning respectively. This study demonstrates the integration of inductive and deductive learning. Additionally, I employed genetic programming to induce symbolic rules, which model selection plays the crucial rule on whether the rules are learnable. By configuring appropriate models based on prior knowledge, we decompose the domain knowledge from the task level to the skill level.</p> -->

								<p>I have always been interested in understanding intelligence, both in humans and in machines. My curiosity centers on the intricacies of reasoning and decision-making, as well as the art of crafting a cognitive architecture that articulates these abilities. Accordingly, my research focuses on two major directions and their integration:</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;">
								  <li>How to build the universal knowledge base of the world?</li>
								  <li>What cognitive functions are imperative for effective decision-making?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've undertaken several research projects around these topics in both computer science and psychology, gaining valuable and diverse insights. The findings from these two directions and their future implications are detailed below.</p>
							  
								<header><h3><strong>Knowledge Base</strong></h3></header>
								<p>Intelligent agents must possess the capability to induce the knowledge model for effective reasoning. My research in the master's program, under the supervision of Professor Tian-Li Yu, introduced an automatic learning framework that integrates inductive and deductive learning. Action schemata in classical planning are induced from demonstrations to guide deep reinforcement learning agents.</p>
								<p>The framework addressed the issues on both approaches, where inductive learning often lacks interpretability and struggles with generalizing to unfamiliar tasks, while deductive learning heavily depends on predefined symbols, making it less practical for real-world scenarios.</p>
								<header><h3><strong>Cognitive Functions</strong></h3></header>
								<p>Of the many mechanisms driving intelligence, I'm particularly drawn to swarm intelligence and reinforcement learning. Both approaches share a key trait: they adapt their behavior based on feedback or interactions with other agents, even without explicit prior knowledge. This adaptability makes them applicable to various domains, allowing agents to leverage their prior knowledge base to accomplish the tasks.</p>

								<p>
									I implemented a distributed multi-agent formation control system on chips using the collective behavior model under the supervision of Professor Tsung-Te Liu. The model employs simple rules at the individual level, acting as an instinctive knowledge base for each agent, while it leads to the emergent behaviors viewed as cognitive functions at the group level. 
									In parallel, my master's thesis explored the application of evolutionary computation with reinforcement learning. Evolutionary computation shows another aspect of swarm intelligence, which induces symbolic rules and provides interpretability about high-level planning, while reinforcement learning is used for low-level execution, which empowers agents to adapt to the environments.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									In another observation, cognition and perception appear deeply interdependent in our brains, leading to multifaceted behaviors. 
									To evaluate the cognitive functions,  I'm keen to explore whether the two mental processes during decision-making can be separately measured. 
									In another undergraduate research, we designed a psychological experiment to analyze the assessment of cognitive and perceptual workload via eye trackers under the supervision of Professor Su-ling Yeh. 
									We found that increasing cognitive (problem difficulties) and perceptual (number of distractors) workload cause opposite effects on eye fixation. 
									This finding extends the late selection hypothesis of perceptual load theory within the context of cognitive workload, providing insight into assessing the cognitive functions of intelligent agents.

								<header><h3><strong>Integration</strong></h3></header>
								<p>Bridging a knowledge base and cognitive functions has been a pivotal focus in my research journey. Cognitive functions draw upon the knowledge base for reasoning, while in return, the knowledge model adapts from the feedback of these functions. I posit that a well-designed neural-symbolic system harnesses the interplay between learning and reasoning.</p>
								<p>
									The instinctive ability of humans with learning and reasoning heralds vast possibilities for future research, such as machine theory of mind, machine common sense, and societal interactions. In addition, large language models have demonstrated an understanding of real-world common sense, suggesting their potential to serve as knowledge bases in cognitive architectures. With interdisciplinary insights from psychology and computer science, I aim to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, contributing to exploring the field of computational cognitive science.
